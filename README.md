#  RyBert

A SpriteKit game for iOS

* Have two types of baddies (blobs and sid), tiles, disks and gamegrid classes
* Need to move player to its own class - Done
* No logic for detecting collisions, levels, end of game, score etc. just yet - Happening
* Do controls work by tapping relative to player, or fixed to screen quadrants? - relative to qbert. Add arrows that disappear soon to help player
* Notification driven system to keep class interactions to the minimum. I like this approach.
